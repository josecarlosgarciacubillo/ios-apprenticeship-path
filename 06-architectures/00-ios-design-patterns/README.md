   I take the chance to follow along with article, learn along in the process and mainly base on his code then I add UI part (in pure code) + modify code slightly + make it runnable on Xcode 8.2 (updated to support Xcode 9.3). Thus Playground projects are ready to test right away. Again big shout out to author.

# Changelog

* All playground projects are updated to be runnable on Xcode 9.3 Playground.
